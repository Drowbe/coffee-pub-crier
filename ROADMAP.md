# Coffee Pub Crier - ROADMAP

<!--
USAGE:
1. To add new items: Add them here in the appropriate section using the format:
   - Your new task title [Priority: P0-P4] [Label: crier, label1, label2]
   They will be automatically created as GitHub Issues.

2. To modify existing items: Edit them in GitHub Issues instead of here.
   This file will be automatically updated to reflect those changes.

This dual workflow allows for easy planning while maintaining GitHub Issues as the source of truth.

PRIORITY COLORS:
P0 - Critical/Blocker
P1 - High Priority
P2 - Medium Priority
P3 - Low Priority
P4 - Documentation/Low Impact
